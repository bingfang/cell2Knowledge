# Cell2Knowledge
## Motivation

The pilot aims to practice to build a comprehensive cell phenotype knowledgebase. This knowledgebase will capture details about cell phenotypes, making it available for research and integrating it with data about diseases and drugs. The goal is to discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

We will use two main sources of knowledge:

1. **Single Cell Genomics Data**: Analyzing data from repositories like CZI CELLxGENE and NeMO to identify cell type-specific marker genes and differential expression patterns.

2. **Peer-Reviewed Publications**: Extracting information from PubMed Central (PMC) about single cell genomics experiments.

The extracted information will be linked with experiment metadata, such as species, sample sources, disease states, and responses to treatments. This data will be structured using semantic web technologies like RDF and OWL, and stored in graph databases like ArangoDB.
